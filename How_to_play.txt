GAMEPLAY:
Our game intends to simulate a basic agriculture and economy. As such there's some rules:
Houses require water, food, and goods to grow larger/better.

Wells and Water supplies will service houses within it's radius with water.

Food is generated by a grain farm or a hunter.
Granaries store the food generated, and ships it to the bazaar.
The Bazaar will service houses within its radius with food.

Goods are furnished by several businesses:
Potter -- Requires a clay pit to make pottery.
Brewery -- Requires a barley farm to make beer.
Weaver -- Requires a flax farm to make linen.

The Bazaar will retrieve finished goods from these businesses.
It will then service houses in it's radius with goods.
All these industries resources are obtained from storage yard supply.

Houses will consume their supplies over time, so keep them fed and stocked!

As you can see the Bazaar is essential to the city, as such we recommend
building it first, as it's also expensive!

To recoup your dwindling funds, bazaars generate profit when they sell goods.
They will deliver this profit to your palace (thus why it is on the map already and cannot be removed).
You can also place a tax collector or gold mine to generate funds.

Other hazards to keep in mind are the potential for crisis.

Houses and industries can burn down, lower the risk with firehouses.
They can also collapse, lower this risk with architect posts.
Thieves may try to steal funds, lower this risk with a police station.
These buildings work in a radius.
